# ProCam_NFT

**What is ProCam:**
ProCam is an interdisciplinary Make project supported by EPFL. The objective of ProCam is to design, build and test a 
new type of connected camera with multiple sensors that can track people while protecting their privacy and at the 
same time identify those with high body temperature.

**The problem:**
For procam, the data is sensitive but still needs to be shared to the authority.  The authority would need to trust that we are sharing the 
right footage and that we have not tampered it. And not only do we need to rely on trust, but the process is not transparent and cannot be traced.

**Proposed solution:**
I am working on solving the issue stated above by using NFT (Non-Fungible-Token)for the transaction of private digital assets, such as procam video. 
Thus leveraging the tech behind it, blockchain, to obtain highly secure, transparent, tamper-proof and immutable transactions that can be programmed through smart contracts.
